# Our `calculator.py` file contains one function definition and a variable
# (the string `author`). It doesn't actually execute any code: if you run
# it directly, nothing appears to happen.
#
# By contrast, `printer.py` prints text when it's run, but it also contains
# a function that we might want to import and use. When we import it, the
# function call on its 10th line is executed. Run this file to see this in action.

import printer

# p.s.: VS Code might alert you, through Pylance, that `printer` isn't
# accessed, but the function call still happens.
